# javascript-belly-button-data

Here is a link to the site that was deployed to GitHub Pages: https://shlokaj2.github.io/javascript-belly-button-data/

The belly button dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in 
more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I have copied the files from the StarterCode folder that we were required to download and moved them into a folder I created called javascript-belly-button-data folder. 
All the code is in the app.js file and everything is running properly, with the charts displaying the data correctly.
