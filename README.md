# javascript-belly-button-data

Here is a link to the site that was deployed to GitHub Pages: https://shlokaj2.github.io/javascript-belly-button-data/

I have added code to the app.js file that is in the javascript-belly-button-data/StarterCode folder. It is currently all completed except for the bubble chart. 
I have the code to create the bubble chart of the data there, but for some reason it is not working and pulling up the bubble chart when I run the code/go live.
