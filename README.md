# javascript-belly-button-data

Here is a link to the site that was deployed to GitHub Pages: https://shlokaj2.github.io/javascript-belly-button-data/

I have added some code to the app.js file that is in the javascript-belly-button-data/StarterCode folder. It is currently incomplete though because I am having 
some trouble with part of the assignment. I will continue to work on it and resubmit it at a later time.
